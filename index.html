   <p><h4>Jungle animals include predators such as tigers, Asian wild dogs and reticulated pythons; herbivores such as forest antelopes,
     Sumatran rhinos and tapirs; birds such as hornbills, macaws and toucans; and aquatic animals such as piranhas, green anacondas and crocodiles.

    Some of the best-known animals that live in jungles are primates. The dense forests are home to many monkey and ape species, including our closest relatives in the animal kingdom:
     bonobos, chimpanzees and gorillas.
    
    On this page is a huge list of amazing jungle animals, with pictures, facts and links to further information.A jungle is a dense forest with thick, tangled undergrowth. Jungles
     are found in tropical regions all around the world. Although inhospitable for humans, jungles are known for their high biodiversity and
     are home to an incredibly large number of plant and animal species.

The word jungle originated in India, and many of the animals below are found in the jungles of India and other Asian countries. Also included in the list are jungle animals from 
Africa, Australia, and South America. You can use the page index below to discover animals that live in jungles in each of these If you're looking for random paragraphs,
 you've come to the right place. When a random word or a random sentence isn't quite enough, the next logical step is to find a random paragraph. We created the Random Paragraph Generator with you in mind. The process is quite simple.
  Choose the number of random paragraphs you'd like to see and click the button. Your chosen number of paragraphs will instantly appear.

While it may not be obvious to everyone, there are a number of reasons creating random paragraphs can be useful. 
A few examples of how some people use this generator are listed in the following paragraphs.Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers 
to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This forces the writer to 
use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as 
the first one of a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have the random
 paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into
  their writing.A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle writers' block. Writing block can often happen due to being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting a completely random 
  paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some of the issues that may have been causing the writers' block in the first place.Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing routine. One way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose here is to just get the 
  writing started so that when the writer goes onto their day's writing projects, words are already flowing from their fingers.Another writing challenge can be to take the individual sentences in the random paragraph and incorporate a single sentence from that into a new paragraph to create a short story. Unlike the random sentence generator, the sentences from the random paragraph will have some connection to one another so it will be a bit different. You also won't
   know exactly how many sentences will appear in the random paragraph.
